# android-nanodegree-project #2 Pupular Movies

# Project Overview

An app to help users discover popular and recent movies. You will build a clean UI, sync to a server, and present information to the user.

By building this app, you will demonstrate your understanding of the foundational elements of programming for Android. Your app will communicate with the Internet and provide a responsive and delightful user experience.

# Requirements

1. You will fetch data from the Internet with theMovieDB API.
2. You will use adapters and custom list layouts to populate list views.
3. You will incorporate libraries to simplify the amount of code you need to write
4. Build a UI layout for multiple Activities.
5. Launch these Activities via Intent.
6. Fetch data from themovieDB API
7. You’ll allow users to view and play trailers ( either in the youtube app or a web browser).
8. You’ll allow users to read reviews of a selected movie.
9. You’ll also allow users to mark a movie as a favorite in the details view by tapping a button(star). This is for a local movies collection that you will maintain and does not require an API request*.
10. You’ll modify the existing sorting criteria for the main view to include an additional pivot to show their favorites collection.
11. You will optimize the UI experience for both phones and tablets.
